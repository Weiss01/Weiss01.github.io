# data-analyser

This data analyser uses dataframe-js to read and analyse a specific format of csv files and show the results and status of the data based on the quality of the data and mode of calculations.

This is my first ever attempt at using javascript so the code is bad and alot of it is very redundant.

# Libraries used
- dataframe-js by Gmousse https://github.com/Gmousse/dataframe-js
- bignumber-js by Evalir https://github.com/MikeMcl/bignumber.js/

dataframe-js is kind of like a replica of pandas from python whereas bignumber-js was used to avoid rounding errors.
